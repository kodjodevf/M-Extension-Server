# M-Extension-Server — headless Mihon (Tachiyomi)/Aniyomi extensions server

M-Extension-Server is a lightweight, headless service for running Mihon (Tachiyomi)/Aniyomi extensions (APKs). It dynamically loads extensions from Base64-encoded APKs, executes catalogue and content methods (manga/anime), and returns results via a small HTTP API.

## Mangatan compatibility

The `v1.0.4.1` release adds the bridge protocol used by Mangatan for
factory-created sources and live extension preferences. A compatible server
advertises `mangatanMihonBridge`, `sourceFactory`, `preferenceCallbacks`,
`sourceUrls`, `imageProxy`, and `youtubeResolver` from `GET /capabilities`.

`GET /youtube/resolve?url=<youtube-video-url>` resolves video metadata,
playable streams, separate audio tracks, and subtitles with NewPipe Extractor.

The manga bridge implements the TachiyomiX 1.6 source API, including combined
manga updates, source memo metadata, and suspend image URL resolution. Legacy
RxJava extensions continue to work through compatibility fallbacks.

## Desktop and iOS runtimes

The normal `:server:shadowJar` task builds the desktop server and retains
KCEF/JCEF plus its native desktop dependencies. Mangatan's on-device iOS
bridge uses `-PiosRuntime=true`, which replaces the logging backend and
excludes Chromium, JCEF, JOGL, and other desktop-only runtime classes.

Both modes compile the same bridge and extension-compatibility code. Pull
requests build and test both variants. Each changed iOS server JAR requires a
new immutable `ios-runtime-v*` release and checksum. The separate embedded
OpenJDK release only needs rebuilding when its OpenJDK sources, patches, or
toolchain change.
